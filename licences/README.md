licences
========

First of all, this is not a magic recipe that will make you software inviolable. If you don't deliver a signed jar, anybody could easily unpack the jar and replace the `if (keyManager.hasValidLicence() == >>>false<<<)` by `if (keyManager.hasValidLicence() == ***true***)`.

product key
-----------

The product key can hide a few bits in the message. The main issue with this method is that you are meant to store the signature that is used to generate and read in the client software. That implies you'll have to find a proper way to obfuscate the way you retrieve this signature.

In order to avoid the false positive, the signature of the product key is salted with the sha-1 of the product key owner and the secret information is stored by default 3 times in the key.

take a look at `org.wima.productkey.ProductKeyManagerImpl` for the key reading.
take a look at `org.wima.productkey.ProductKeyGenerator` for the key generation.

licence key
-----------

The licence key is generated by signing a serialized java object that holds the licence information. No body else that the private key owner can generate a licence, and you only need the public to embed the public key in the client's software.

take a look at `org.wima.licencekey.LicenceManagerImpl` for the licence generation and verification.
